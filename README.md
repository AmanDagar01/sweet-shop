📸 Screenshots
1. Dashboard & Inventory
Users can view all available sweets, see live stock levels, and purchase items. Items with 0 stock are disabled. 

2. User Login
Secure login page that issues a JWT for session management. 

3. Admin: Add New Sweet
An interface for admins to add new inventory items to the database. 

4. API Documentation (Swagger UI)
Interactive API docs automatically generated by FastAPI. 

🚀 Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

Node.js 18+

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd sweet-shop
2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder and set up the Python environment.

Bash

cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# (If requirements.txt is missing, run: pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy passlib[bcrypt] python-jose[cryptography] multipart requests pytest httpx)

# Run the Server
uvicorn main:app --reload
The backend will run on http://localhost:8000

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and start the Next.js app.

Bash

cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

4. Seed Data (Optional)
To quickly populate your database with test users and sweets, run the seed script from the root directory:

Bash

python seed_data.py
📖 API Documentation
Once the backend is running, you can access the full API documentation at: http://localhost:8000/docs

This interactive UI allows you to test endpoints manually (authenticate via the "Authorize" button).

🧪 Running Tests
This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD). To run the backend test suite:

Bash

cd backend
pytest
Expected output:

backend/tests/test_auth.py ..
backend/tests/test_inventory.py ..
backend/tests/test_main.py .
backend/tests/test_sweets.py ..
🤖 My AI Usage
In compliance with the project's AI policy, I utilized AI tools to assist in the development process.

AI Tool Used: Gemini (Google)

Usage:

Boilerplate Generation: I used Gemini to generate the initial directory structure and the "Walking Skeleton" for the FastAPI backend.

Debugging: AI helped resolve a version conflict between passlib and bcrypt by suggesting a compatible version pin.

Frontend Logic: I utilized AI to write the api.ts Axios interceptor to automatically attach JWT tokens to requests.

Test Cases: I brainstormed edge cases for the inventory logic (e.g., purchasing out-of-stock items) with the AI.

Reflection: AI significantly sped up the setup phase and helped catch configuration errors early. However, manual coding was essential for the specific business logic (like the inventory decrements) and ensuring the frontend components matched the backend data models.

Next Steps:

Implement "Admin Only" role protection for the Add/Delete endpoints.

Deploy to Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend).
